# Prompt themes

A unified collection of custom themes for Starship and Oh My Posh.  
This repository centralizes configuration, shared assets, and utilities for maintaining consistent terminal prompts
across shells and operating systems.

```shell
# On Linux or macOS
export STARSHIP_CONFIG=~/example/non/default/path/starship.toml
export POSH_THEME=~/example/non/default/path/oh-my-posh.yaml

# On Windows PowerShell
$ENV:STARSHIP_CONFIG = "$HOME\example\non\default\path\starship.toml"
$ENV:POSH_THEME  = "$HOME\example\non\default\path\oh-my-posh.yaml"
```
